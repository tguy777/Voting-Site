<h2 style="color:red;">Have you ever wanted to choose the people who will lead you?</h2>
<h3 style="color:DarkBlue;">Have you thought that the way our prefects are chosen is unfair?</h3>
<p style="color:DarkBlue;">Well think no further because we present to you PEPPS's very own voting site.<br>A prefects duties are very difficult as they have to uphold their schools dignity and teachings.<br>
They have to lead by example and inforce the rules of the school and reprimind those who do not follow them.<br>That's the reason why we need competent people to lead the PEPPS school int the future.<br>And that's the reason 
why the students of PEPPS should be involved in choosing their future leaders!
</p>
<h2 style="color:red;"> How prefects are nominated.</h2>
<p style="color:DarkBlue;">When teachers chose prefects they look for people who have good leadership skills and are well behaved.They will send a list of candidates on google classroom and we vote for who we sit fit to lead us<br>
on a google form.We decided that we are going to make a website where all the teachers need to do is put a list of candidates and we vote for them on this website.</p>

<h2 style="color:red;">Choose your fututre leaders!</h2>
